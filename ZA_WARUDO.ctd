					<rich_text>Mother, Father, God Shroom, He Who Lives Within. Some of the names ascribed to this massive growth in the middle of an unnamed swamp far away from any greater civilization.

Surrounding this being, a small ramshackle hamlet has sprung from the wet and muck. Inhabited by those who have long since given up on their own lives, they now live only to safeguard and worship the apparent deity in their midst.

The being demands only one thing, sustenence. This can be anything from plants, berries, mold to small animals, people or, when opportunity arises, extraplanar beings. Everything that is presented to the fungal lord is slowly decomposed by unnatural means and absorbed by the mass over the course of hours or days.

In return, the benevolent master blesses its supplicants with eternal, painless life. But pain is not the only thing lacking, but emotions, bliss, ambitions, worries and pride all melt away over time. The long tendril-like roots of the being permeating the land and everything upon it, creating strands of influence that it can use to take direct control of its followers.

Not all who worship turn into mindless thralls however, there are those who retain their selves. These are the Rot Priests. Bent on spreading the word of their progenitor, they travel far and wide, utilizing their abhorrent magic to heal and inspire others to follow them back home, to join their family of eternal existence.</rich_text>

						<rich_text>Also known as the Bloodletter
Tgran was a region-renowned swordmaster and duelist
One day he came across a cursed blade and picked it up out of hubris, certain he could bend it to his will.
The blade did not wish to serve however, and demanded to be steeped in blood in order to enter a pact with Tgran.
He did as he was told, for months he journeyed the land, seeking any opportunity to do battle and stirred up conflict when none could be found.
Eventually the blade succumbed to his will, at least that is what he thought.
He spent many years on the roads, acting as a mercenary, assassin, raider, or whatever else he felt like for the time being, holding no loyalties to anyone but himself.
However, over time he grew weary of the constant battle, and decided to lay down the blade and retire. The blade however did not agree to this. For it had a knack of influencing its surroundings to bring it where it wanted to be. And where it wanted to be was in the hands of Tgran.
It traded hands many times on its journey back to its servant, growing more and more resentful for every new fledgling novice to wave it around in futile attempts at greatness. It drained these worthless instruments of its journey to bare husks of their former selves, first of personality and ambitions, finally of their own blood and vitals.
It always finds its way back to its favored servant, and upon doing so it shares the life force it has consumed on its path there.
Tgran now strives to do as little harm as possible with the cursed artifact he carries with him, but at the same time knowing it has to be fed, or it surely will eventually tire of him. Were this to happen it would certainly carve an even bigger swathe of death and despair as it searched for a new master willing to attempt to weild it for their own means.

These formations let out a constant noise, sounding much like the lamentations of people wracked with grief. Prolonged exposure to this sound, or even a brief moment when the sound is at its most intense, is enough to lure individuals to approach them. Upon doing so, and placing ones bare skin upon the coarse surface of the monoliths, one will find themself unable to move away, being slowly dragged into the rock as if it were made of some kind of liquid rather than the solid stone they appear to be. Swift action is required to either sever the limb or, if enough force is available, shatter the figurine.

					<rich_text>Once upon a time, Denfaux was a place dedicated to the teaching, research, preservation and development of all known arts.
From painting to martial arts, architecture to arcane studies, history to necromancy and much, much more. No subject was excluded, regardless of social or societal taboo.

One day or gradually over time, noone knows for sure, entire quarters of the school began drifting in and out of existance. Time seemed to flow at irregular intervals and locations began moving around, with corridors leading into flat walls, rooms looping in on themselves and the scale of entire quarters growing or shrinking seemingly at random.

The inhabitants of this place have warped into abhorrent parodies of their past selves. A world renowned artist may have grown bored of the mundane tools of their trade, turning to crafting sculptures from the rot and filth of themselves or others. Maybe even integrating explorers or their fellow artists into their works. A songwrite might spin melodies that defy sane sensibilities, with only hearing the noise they produce being enough to wring minds away from sanity.

These works, stories and similar is of high value to collectors of the perverse in the outside world, and an entire city has been erected on the outskirts of the School that thrives on the traffic generated by explorers, thrill seekers and treasure hunters that seek to dare Denfaux.</rich_text>

The chimaeran curse alters the victims physiology, greatly increasing their strenght, vigor, endurance and libido.
The most striking effect however, is the one that lets the holder mate with any species, as long as it uses with the usual male-female method of procreation.
There are some exceptions to this rule, with some males carrying the curse being able to inseminate eggs of other species as an example.
The offspring of these unnatural unions will bear a conglomeration of traits from both of its parents. One conceived from a man and a horse might sport the lower body of a horse, with a mans torso, arms and head taking the place of the horse's head. A bird that roosts over a snake's egg might produce a winged serpent.
One unfortunate side-effect of the curse for bearing females is that their bodies are rarely build in a way to accomodate the birth of these freaks of nature, and as such the mortality rate of birthing mothers is extremely high.

									<rich_text>The Gori'Lak are tribal nomads, with a naming convention of placing the name of the tribe first, followed by the name of the individual. Feyen'Tac for example is “Tac of tribe Feyen”. Gori'Lak can be roughly translated as “Tribe of All” and is a word for referencing all tribes. Other names for them are Beastmen, Accursed Ones and Freakbands to name a few.

The Gori'Lak are generally wholly inclusive to anyone seeking a place to belong and to find kindred beings. The only things the typical tribe demands is total allegience to the tribe's leader and that the individual carries their own weight. For example, an individual unable to gather or prepare food to feed themselves can still be accepted into the tribe. The work that others put into keeping them alive just has to be repaid to the tribe in another way, perhaps by telling stories, educating the ones bright enough or acting as diplomats on the behalf of the tribe. This structure usually inspires, fosters and maintains fierce loyalty from the members towards the tribe, and most won't hesitate to throw themselves into danger to protect it.

The Heigans are a civilization based in the western mountain ranges of Larannia. Centuries ago, the community was formed by outcasts of human settlements spread throughout the lands. Children born with dwarfism were shunned by their peers, living lives of ridicule, servitude and disrespect. Over time these poor souls grew tired of living at the bottom of the social ladder, and banded together to create their own land and cities, far from the prying eyes of the “Tall ones”.

Heigan society has a long standing resentment towards “regular” humans, banning them from entering their most sacred places and confronting them with strict tradelaws and routes of travel.

With their entire culture being born from resentment and a desire to stand on their own, they have carried with them for centures a tradition of Gezvell, or “Scorn Songs”. In these a family would recite the wrongs that have been carried out towards them, reminding themselves until payment has been done to rectify, or vengeance had been carried out. These songs can last anywhere from minutes to hours to sing out, and are usually recited at social gatherings or similar.</rich_text>

Most are capable of flight, spurting a wingspan that can put entire towns, and in some cases cities, in their shade when they pass by.

Each Draegir is a wholly unique being with size, behaviour, goals, abilities and allegiances varying wildly between individuals.

They have no natural limit to their lifespan, but also cannot reproduce. This means that the ones created at the birth of their species are all there is, and with time they have become more and more secluded, keeping to their own and rarely meddling in the affairs of mortals.

Cults, societies and followings are centered around these beings throughout the land, and while most Draegir see these as troublesome or annoying, there are those that thrive on the worship and adoration they receive fromt heir supplicants.

Draegir are sex-less and conform to no hierarchy or higher power. They are the Apex Predators of the world, with no natural enemies or dangers other than arguably the leviathans of the deep seas. These pose little threat however as the Draegir seldom have reason to stray near their terretories.</rich_text>

They come in all manner of different forms, sizes and social structures, from skittering pack hunters to towering alpha predators. Most commonly found in the Hestrian Pit, but can also, on rare occasions, be sighted throughout the land.

								<rich_text>The Thacka were brutal tribal humanoids that lead savage campaigns of war in past ages.

More constructs than biological beings, they were born and tempered in fire, with said fire being a major focalpoint to them culturally.

They had an extremely strict hierarchy, with tribe members only ever socializing with members of their own caste and only taking orders from the caste above them.

Fiercly xenophobic, they saw all other races as either annoyances to rid themselves of or potential adversaries to test and sharpen their wit of war.

Their sole method of reproducing were to burn dead combatants in grand War Pyres, where they laden their corpses with offerings. Wargear, foods, works of art and anything of any semblence of value is added to the bonfire during the ritual.

After the fires die out, from the ashes a new set of Thacka will emerge. The higher the quality of the dead and the offerings added to the flames, the more powerful these new tribes members will be. Immediately on their emergence, the hierarchy of the tribe undergoes reevaluation. Generally it is quite simple, with the bigger the individual the higher their rank. This can be, and on occation is, challenged by a smaller tribe member, demanding trial by combat to assert dominance over larger members.

Physically the Thacka are fearsome to even the most stalwart of mortal warriors. Standing almost three meters tall, with arms thick as barrels and covered in oily scales with feather-like fur growing almost like a moss over their back.</rich_text>
